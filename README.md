# Copy Syntax in Light

Copy code from dark themes with clean, readable formatting for light backgrounds.

## The Problem

When you copy code from VS Code with a dark theme and paste it into a light background (documentation, Notion, emails, etc.), the syntax highlighting disappears or looks wrong. You either manually reformat it or use an external tool.

## The Solution

Select your code, run Copy Syntax in Light, and the extension handles the rest:

1. Temporarily switches to a light theme
2. Copies your selected code with proper formatting
3. Switches back to your original theme

Done in seconds. No configuration needed.

## Features

- Copy code with light theme syntax highlighting
- Automatic theme restoration after copying
- Works via keyboard shortcut or context menu
- No setup or configuration required

## How to Use

1. Select the code you want to copy
2. Use **`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`C`** (Windows/Linux) or **`Cmd`+`Shift`+`C`** (Mac) to copy with light theme syntax
3. Or right-click and select "Copy Syntax in Light" from the context menu
4. Paste anywhere with your formatting intact
5. Your original theme is automatically restored

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`C`** (Windows / Linux)
- **`Cmd`+`Shift`+`C`** (macOS)

## Requirements

- VS Code with at least one light theme installed (most VS Code installations include light themes by default)

## Limitations

- Currently switches to the default light theme.
- Custom light theme selection may be added in future versions.
